# doorbell

Code for a Particle.io photon to recieve MIPS messages via a 433Mhz receiver and publish those events, messages can be generated by devices such as the Lloytron doorbells.

The published events can either be consumed as a webhook or the source of an IFTTT recipie.

Connect the 5V and GND lines of the 433 receiver to the Vin and GND pins on the particle, Connect the Data line to D0 

This code will publish all received codes but will only flash the LED and set D7 high if the received code matches the value in MyValue, so you can watch for things like your neighbours doorbells and remote garage doors ;)
